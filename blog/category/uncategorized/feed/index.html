				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">The relationship between Wealth advisors and their clients is similar to that of a parent and a child. The client (read child) in this relationship is always tempted by the lure of quick returns and a focus on immediate expectations.</p>
<p>It may be the latest Crypto investment that catches the client’s fancy, or a new mutual fund with very high returns in the last year, or even a stock tip suggested by a peer. However, the advisor (parent) has to step in as the voice of reason at such times. The advisor has to help them meet their long-term financial goals while still giving them adequate short-term returns to keep them invested.</p>
<p><span id="more-111"></span></p>
<p>Advisors face a three-pronged dilemma when it comes to clients: Knowledge, Time Allocation and Willpower. The advisor of today is capitalizing on technology and turning to investment platforms equipped with advanced analytics and advisory to overcome them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge dilemma:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advisor is always caught between relaying all of the information to the investor or simplifying it and on a need to know basis. It may seem judicious to tell the investor every small detail, however, such an information overload may often lead to choice paralysis.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Solution: Strong user experience and data visualization</p>
<p>Investment platforms of today are equipped with user-friendly interfaces and data visualizations. This helps break down and convey complex data in simple charts and graphs that can be easily digested by the investor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Time allocation dilemma:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of most wealth management firms, the most precious resource is advisor time. A single advisor may be handling up to 20-30 client portfolios in a single year. An advisor has to divide his schedule in a way that every investor gets a fair share of their time. Often advisors have to spend so much time researching and getting up to speed on a customer portfolio before a call/meeting that valuable hours are wasted in preparation rather than customer service.</p>
<p>Solution: Automation of the monitoring and review process</p>
<p>Advisors are now choosing to spend time onboarding a customer onto an investment platform so that investors can monitor and review their portfolio at any time by logging into the system. New age investment platforms equipped with Robo advisory and detailed analytics can help advisors automate most of the research that goes into investing, saving valuable advisor time. These platforms also may have simplified app versions, that can be accessed on the go, so that the advisor can be on top of things 24&#215;7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Willpower dilemma:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An advisor is only human, in many cases, they might find themselves emotionally attached to a certain fund or scheme. This might be because they have got them attractive returns in the past or because of some underlying bias towards a brand. In such cases, it is hard to be objective even when the scheme is underperforming and it tests the willpower of the advisor.</p>
<p>Solution: Strong decision architecture with Robo advisory</p>
<p>Robo advisors help temper the gut instinct of a human advisor with insights and recommendations powered by data. Advisors are often blinded by bias and refuse to make tough decisions such as dropping a fund or booking a loss. The investment platforms of today simplify their detailed analytics into actionable insights and recommendations, helping advisors overcome their blind spots and rebalance their portfolio to chart their course to safer waters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The mutual benefits for investors and advisors</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adoption of ‘Investment platforms’ by Wealth management firms gives advisors the ability to focus on customer service and ensures that investors have complete transparency on their portfolio.</p>
<p>There is a slow yet steady push towards leveraging Analytics and AI in the space. Indian investors are picking up on global cues to demand world-class technology from their wealth advisors.</p>
<p>Although the ‘investment technology’ space is still nascent in the country, there are already a few emerging market pioneers. Wealthfy<strong>,</strong> the Robo advisory enabled investment platform from Valuefy was recently awarded ‘Best Wealth Management Technology Platform’ at AIWMI’s  India Wealth Awards 2018, the biggest and most prestigious showcase of excellence in the Wealth management industry. Over 30 leading institutions like Reuters, Aditya Birla Group, Kotak AMC and WGC have already adopted the platform and other Financial institutions are following suit.</p>
<p>Eventually, the adoption of investment platforms will become the new status quo. These platforms help make the process of investing more transparent. With the focus on simplification, rather than obfuscation, investment platforms are helping empower Indian investors and advisors alike.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content"><strong>The wisdom of the web: The future of wealth management is data-driven</strong></p>
<div>The idea of comparing and reviewing something online before making a decision haspermeated indelibly into the decision-making process of a millennial. Be it buying a hometheatre, getting health insurance, renting a home, or buying a car. The consumer of today isspoilt for choice, they make their own decisions, do their own research, and rely on the power oftechnology to make judgements, be it big or small.</div>
<div>
<div class="t pg-1m0 pg-1x0 pg-1h1 pg-1y7 pg-1ff2 pg-1fs0 pg-1fc0 pg-1sc0 pg-1ls0 pg-1ws0"></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><span id="more-65"></span></p>
<p>Why should wealth management be any different? The investors of today rely on advice from a host of sources while making any financial decision. They seek advice online, through blogs, forums, news, social media, stock trading platforms and peers before any buy or sell.</p>
<p>People are increasingly soliciting financial advice online and are comfortable making decisionsleveraging on their digital outreach. In this landscape, it becomes essential for wealthmanagement firms to markedly differentiate themselves by providing in-depth analysis and datato back up every decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information overload: The crippling effect</strong></p>
<p class="t pg-1m0 pg-1x0 pg-1h1 pg-1y10 pg-1ff2 pg-1fs0 pg-1fc0 pg-1sc0 pg-1ls0 pg-1ws0">However, when it comes to relying on multiple sources to make a decision, there is always a crippling effect due to an overload of information. Financial advisors and Portfolio managers often suffer decision paralysis due to the overwhelming amount of information available on the internet that confuses rather than helps the reader. This often leads to a bias for inaction, rather than action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The unlikely savior: AI-based Robo advisory</strong></p>
<p class="t pg-1m0 pg-1x0 pg-1h1 pg-1y16 pg-1ff2 pg-1fs0 pg-1fc0 pg-1sc0 pg-1ls0 pg-1ws0">Robo advisory, financial advisory tools that leverage proprietary AI and self-learning algorithms to create customized portfolio recommendations, are becoming the preferred research and decision making platform for the tech-savvy investor.</p>
<p class="t pg-1m0 pg-1x0 pg-1h1 pg-1y16 pg-1ff2 pg-1fs0 pg-1fc0 pg-1sc0 pg-1ls0 pg-1ws0">It is a technology solution that is breaking new ground in the wealth management space as it combines the benefits of going to multiple news sites, channels, review sites, and neatly delivers it in the form of actionable advice and intelligence.</p>
<div>
<div class="t pg-1m0 pg-1x0 pg-1h1 pg-1y1c pg-1ff2 pg-1fs0 pg-1fc0 pg-1sc0 pg-1ls0 pg-1ws0">They are also equipping traditional wealth management firms with the power to base their financial decisions on data and analytics rather than instinct. Robo advisors are helping clients such as financial institutions, wealth management firms and even the average investor automate a large portion of the tedious research that goes into investing.</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The promise of better tomorrow: Chasing the alpha</strong></p>
<div class="t pg-2m0 pg-2x0 pg-2h1 pg-2y1 pg-2ff2 pg-2fs0 pg-2fc0 pg-2sc0 pg-2ls0 pg-2ws0">It is clear that the combination of machine intelligence and human instinct can prove to be a winner for investors across the board. While they are not a one size fits all solution, the level of customization and goal setting offered by new age Robo advisory platforms are helping investors integrate Robo advisory inputs into a holistic investing strategy. As algorithms keep evolving and getting better, the day isn&#8217;t too far when technology can help investors beat the market consistently.</div>
<div>
<div class="t pg-2m0 pg-2x0 pg-2h1 pg-2y7 pg-2ff2 pg-2fs0 pg-2fc0 pg-2sc0 pg-2ls0 pg-2ws0">The ‘Investment Technology’ industry is still in a very nascent stage in India, with a large number of firms yet to adapt to the paradigm shift. Players such as <span class="pg-2ff1">Valuefy </span>are leading the pack in driving Robo advisory and technology based investing in India, with over <span class="pg-2ff1">30 l</span>eading financial institutions on board. Market leaders such as Kotak AMC, Aditya Birla capital and Waterfield advisors have partnered with Valuefy to power their Robo Advisory.</div>
