				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">The Human Wealth Manager is a very precious resource, and often extremely expensive,  with median salaries of<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/03/13/how-much-do-wall-streeters-really-earn/#4b738b246235"> well over 100K</a> (Census data collected by WSJ). In such a scenario private wealth management firms often tend to overwork and spread thin their accounts, in some firms, it was found that Wealth managers were juggling between <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moiravetter/2018/07/18/ai-and-machine-learning-will-transform-wealth-management/#60ba16f277de">200 to 500 </a>portfolios in a work week. This led to many wealth managers working well over<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/27/the-cult-of-overwork"> 80 &#8211; 100 hour </a>work weeks.</p>
<p><span id="more-152"></span></p>
<p>However pulling such long work hours often mean that Wealth Managers often become less efficient and often develop depression, anxiety, immune disorders that affect their quality of life, efficiency, and their decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How can Artificial Intelligence make a difference?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>AI is helping <a href="https://www.valuefy.com/wealthfy">Wealth Management</a> firms optimize their Wealth Management process and reduce the strain on Human Wealth managers by automating a lot of the research, onboarding, goal setting, and operations that goes into wealth management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading Investment technology firms such as Valuefy are creating sophisticated Wealth Management platforms and Robo advisory services that crunch through Terabytes of data in seconds compared to hours of manual research. Big data analysis is helping Wealth Management professionals create better models and strategies for their firms by factoring in more strategies and variables and thereby tempering the tendency to make biased decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These platforms are also helping Human Managers organize their portfolio lifecycle better by leveraging real time insights. This helps Wealth Managers at large firms managing 200+ portfolios a day dedicate their attention to macro and micro trends and take corrective action or rebalancing if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using these big data platforms can also help Wealth Managers have data driven and nuanced conversations with their clients. It can help clients feel at ease and assuaged to have hard data backing up their investment strategies. Overall it helps Wealth Managers to be proactive and respond to trends quickly, leaving customers feeling more valued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The major benefit, however, is that it helps Wealth Managers free up their time by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XutHs_pYbJk"> almost 20%</a>. This translates to almost a whole day a week, which can be better utilised to reevaluate strategies, cement relationships, prospecting and more rather than day to day portfolio management operations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">
<p style="text-align: left;">As the adage goes, the best time to start investing is yesterday, the second best time is now. Millennials want to invest their money, however, a major roadblock that stops them is that they often consider their earnings too paltry to start investing. This feeling may often last till their late 30s or 40s until they start making reasonable incomes, the kind that the baby boomers were making in their early 20s.</p>
<p><span id="more-137"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most traditional advisors have minimum asset requirements which are quite steep such as assets of $500,000 or more which puts them out of reach for the average Millennial. Traditional advisors also charge sizeable commissions, on average of 1% to 2% of assets under management. In such a scenario, Millennials are wary of traditional advisors as they have to beat the market by a large margin to even cover the high cost of commision and create any value.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Added to this, millennials also tend to have a heightened mistrust of financial institutions. This is due to the fact that most millennials grew up and had their most formative years during the great depression. The combination of these factors makes millennials hesitant to adhere to ‘status quo’ investment patterns, instead, they prefer to put their trust in tech-driven or DIY solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The paradigm shift: from trusting people to trusting Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest challenge in DIY investing is often getting started, what information to consume, what to disregard, and what to act on. The entire process gets a bit overwhelming as there’s information overload on the internet which tends to cripple modern-day investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Established news sites like Moneycontrol, Bloomberg, Economic Times, Financial times are all fine sources for investment advice, however, for a beginner investor, it can be a nightmare to track and monitor the news constantly and connect the right dots. Gathering the right inferences from a glut of data is what makes DIY investing so challenging.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Artificial intelligence based solutions offered by Robo advisors can help solve this problem, by creating curated and actionable advice according to goals set by investors. AI can churn through Terabytes of data, study market trends, make analyses and projections and give out predictions that minimize risks involved in DIY investing. The technology may seem complicated, but the end user benefits as they only have to act on ‘actionable advice’ while all the complicated algorithms do the number crunching for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robo-advisors chart the best course of action by analyzing goals, risk tolerance, and investment preferences. Investors can monitor the entire process through simplified dashboards that offer different levels of granularity. Most Robo-advisors are clear and transparent and often intuitive to modern day users who use apps for everything from ordering food, getting around town, and even dating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why Robo-advisors? &#8211; Convenient, low fees and DIY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The interest in Robo-advisors as an ideal solution for millennial investors is being spurred by increased transparency, accessibility, low fees and best in class customer experience offered by them as opposed to traditional advisors. The ability to invest via apps on their phone or on the web has led to another spurt in the growth the category.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most Robo-advisors charge up to 0.50% of total assets under management with most advisors offering free services until $5000 or $10,000, depending on their target audience. They also hold off on charging account-opening fees, withdrawal or account-closing fees, trading/commission fees, or account transfer fees and stick to clear and simple management fees to appeal to millennials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Is a Robo advisor the right fit for you?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are just getting started in investing and want to dabble in the markets yourself while still minimizing risks, Robo-advisors are your best bet. Their simplified user experience can help you monitor your finances on the go, eventually developing a taste for investments. Robo-advisors can help you temper your instincts and make better decisions, all without incurring the costs and inconveniences that come with a traditional human advisor. Even experienced investors are choosing to go the Robo route and transition from expensive actively managed accounts to low-cost automated alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robo advisory, however, is not a one size fits all solution. There needs to be careful consideration of one’s financial goals before settling on one. If you have a large and complicated estate, or you’re invested into many different types of assets a human touch may be necessary. They may also not be the right fit if you have specific needs that don’t fit traditional models such as succession planning, multi-currency portfolios etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, these aren’t really the target audience for Roboadvisors. If you have a fairly simple and more straightforward portfolio and you just want to get started, then Robo-advisors are the perfect starting point for your investing journey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">Millennials are markedly different in their approach to investing than Baby boomers (Generation X), for one, they grew up and lived their most impressionable years during the great depression and saw the brunt of the housing crisis at its peak. They have also lived through the dot-com bubble and many see the markets as rigged in favour of the big guns.</p>
<p><span id="more-114"></span></p>
<p>This created an inherent fear of the stock market in the entire generation. So much so, that they are wary of the traders or investment bankers and see them largely as snake oil salesmen. However, on the flip side, this skepticism and pessimism about the market make them cautious investors. Most millennials are very wary of where they invest their money, hence, they tend to do a lot more research, online and vet any opportunity thoroughly before investing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Millennial mindset: Investing with a heart</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tendency of millennials to do their own research about companies also means that they actively seek out companies that reflect their core values. Whether it is being environmentally conscious or ethically sourced, the investor of today cares about putting their money where their heart is. Cutting corners or unethical labour practices can be a death knell in today’s stock market as Millennials care deeply, more than any previous generation, about sustainability and a company’s moral compass. The massive success of Nike’s Colin Kaepernick campaign is evidence of this investing mindset. Although controversial, the campaign that stood in support of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign led to a surge in online sales by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/09/08/study-nike-online-sales-up-after-colin-kaepernick-ad/1240378002/">almost 31%, </a>mostly driven by Millennials. This despite the backlash by the ‘baby boomer’ generation and by president Trump himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tools for the Millennial investor: Simplified investing with complete transparency</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach of being ‘invested’ in ‘investing’ means that Millennials are looking for more DIY platforms to investing and more transparency at every stage of the process. They prefer to do their own research and are often on the lookout for tech that makes their lives easier. New age investing platforms are doing just that, providing investors with the tech they need to get started while keeping it simple and user-friendly. Similar to any other choice that they make, millennials care about customer convenience. Similar to an Uber, Venmo, Tinder or any other service that they use, Millennials love services that enable them at the click of a button. Investment platforms are adapting to this by focusing on user experience and convenience for the investor. They are focusing on building solutions also help automate the tedious research that goes into investing and helping create savvy Millennial investors. The investment platforms that will come out on top are those that successfully use tech to simplify the steep learning curve that comes with investing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Every penny counts: Advanced analytics and tracking for the inquisitive investor</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another defining characteristic of the generation is that they are often burdened with student debt, as well as lower incomes, uncertain futures, and less job security than the baby boomers. In such a scenario, they care more about where every penny is being spent and are less likely to ‘trust’ their Wealth advisors. Wealth management firms have to adapt to this trend by justifying every investing decision or recommendation with hard data and analytics. Platforms like <a href="https://www.valuefy.com/wealthfy"><strong>WealthFy</strong></a> that allow for detailed reporting, analytics, portfolio attribution and monitoring will help new investors feel at ease. AI enabled Robo advisory is another major driving force in helping temper ‘gut based’ investing, helping assuage concerns for Millennials who often have a diminished risk appetite.</p>
<p>The Wealth management firm that serves their users with a dedicated and high-quality app along with exceptional customer service is likely to have the edge in landing a Millennial client. Failure to adapt to the shifting paradigms will eventually lead to many of the laggard firms being phased out to be replaced by ‘tech enabled’ firms or by DIY investing platforms.</p></div>
