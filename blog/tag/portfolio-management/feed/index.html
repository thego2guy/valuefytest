				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">Wealth Management is becoming more consumer-friendly, affordable and accessible than ever before. As the serviceable demographic of the Wealth Management industry changes to Millenials who are coming of age in terms of their investing prime, there is a need to shift the methods and technologies in the space to accommodate their tastes and preferences.</p>
<p><span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>Tech-savvy millennial customers have come to expect on-demand access to their portfolio data as well as 24X7 Monitoring and Customer support. Forward-looking Wealth Management firms are adopting Data science, Robo advisory, and Analytics solutions to power their management and operations strategy and tailor them to suit this customer demographic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there’s a lot of ambiguity and misinformation out there on what these technologies can and cannot do. This is leading to fearmongering amongst the Wealth Management community that Human Advisors are slowly being phased out in favour of their Robo/Tech counterparts. Here we’ve tried to clear the air on what Investment Technology is capable of and what lies outside its scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Robo Advisors:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiction: </strong>Robo advisors are here to replace human Wealth Advisors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fact: </strong>Robo advisors offer a customized investment strategy and recommendations based on data gathered on investor’s risk tolerance, objectives, time horizon, and other background demographics. Although Robo Advisors are an extremely powerful tool, they have their limitations, especially in the case of individuals with complicated investment goals such as estate planning, taking care of dependents, or saving for illnesses. Robo advisors can assist Wealth Managers or Investors as part of a holistic investment plan, however, they are not a one size fits all solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Management Platforms:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiction: </strong>Wealth Management platforms are not used by High Networth (HNI) Clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fact: </strong>HNI Clients expect exceptional customer service and availability 24X7. Wealth Management platforms with mobile and web portals help them monitor their portfolios and finances on the go and helps them have more insightful conversations with their Wealth Managers. HNI clients, in fact, prefer a ‘High touch’ approach, a blend of Human and Robo capabilities. Technology gives them instant access and insights on their finances and Wealth advisors can step in when they face a particularly complex problem or financial goal. This ‘High touch’ approach helps free up advisor time to cement client relationships and focus on strategy rather than daily operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Analytic Solutions :</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiction: </strong>Analytics platforms make your decisions for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fact: </strong>The Analytics platforms of today crunch through Terabytes of data from international data sources such as Reuters, Bloomberg, Moneycontrol among others. They provide recommendations based on your portfolio data and risk tolerance, however, the final decision is left to the Wealth Manager or Investor.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">Are human advisors being edged out by the Robo Advisory revolution? That is the question that’s troubling the wealth management industry moving into 2019. The future of wealth management seems to be in a state of flux, human advisors are apprehensive about the developments in Robo advisory, they aren’t sure whether Robo advisors are here to help them, supplement them or replace them entirely.</p>
<p><span id="more-144"></span></p>
<p>The answers aren&#8217;t clear at this point, however, Roboadvisory is forcing the industry to take notice and modernize to stay relevant. Roboadvisory is taking the wealth management space by storm, catering to millennials, these firms are mobile first, customer friendly, and transparent. They are a vast improvement on the opaque and inaccessible fashion in which traditional wealth management firms operate.</p>
<p>Millennial investors are curious about how their money is being invested, and Roboadvisory is helping them gain control and confidence over their finances. Investors are increasingly choosing Robo advisors as they are more accessible (Most platforms have web and mobile apps), more streamlined, and offer more value, especially to those with uncomplicated financial goals and needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for traditional wealth management firms?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional wealth management firms need to embrace the changes that are taking hold of the industry and adapt if they want to survive. Artificial Intelligence is helping temper the decision-making process, helping investors derisk their investment strategy in favour of a more holistic and data-driven approach. AI insights that are culled out from terabytes of data can help both professional advisors as well as laymen investors, make better decisions.</p>
<p>It may not be the solution for investors with complex needs and larger estates, but it can help those who cannot afford the high fees charged by traditional wealth management firms (around 1%-2% of AUM). Also, the low minimum asset requirements on Roboadvisory platforms (around $1000 &#8211; $10,000) as compared to high requirements of traditional firms ($100,000) make Robo platforms a lucrative option for beginners.</p>
<p>Robo-advisory in their current form is catering largely to DIY investors and supplementing traditional advisors, leading to a High Touch approach (Mix of tech and human advisory). Adaptable wealth management firms stand to benefit from this expansion of their customer universe, they can bolster their bottom line from being able to serve both small-scale investors as well as High Networth Individuals with complicated investment goals.</p>
<p>Integrating Roboadvisory into their roster of services is helping banks and wealth management firms free up valuable advisor time. Advisor portals and apps are helping clients gain more transparency on the state of their portfolios, in turn helping clients and human advisors have more insightful conversations about financial goals and strategies.</p>
<p>An ecosystem where Roboadvisory platforms and Human advisors coexist will inspire an ecosystem of trust and collaboration by reducing information asymmetry that plagues traditional investing. Investors across the board will benefit from being able to monitor and assess the state of their own finances in real time.</p>
<p>The human touch can never be eliminated as algorithms cannot assuage investor’s fears or offer solutions for complex needs such as succession/estate planning, elder care, tax and healthcare planning. However, technology can help automate and streamline a large portion of conventional financial planning, helping human advisors focus on complex, unique challenges posed by individual portfolios and leaving the humdrum of financial planning to Robo-advisors.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">
<p style="text-align: left;">As the adage goes, the best time to start investing is yesterday, the second best time is now. Millennials want to invest their money, however, a major roadblock that stops them is that they often consider their earnings too paltry to start investing. This feeling may often last till their late 30s or 40s until they start making reasonable incomes, the kind that the baby boomers were making in their early 20s.</p>
<p><span id="more-137"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most traditional advisors have minimum asset requirements which are quite steep such as assets of $500,000 or more which puts them out of reach for the average Millennial. Traditional advisors also charge sizeable commissions, on average of 1% to 2% of assets under management. In such a scenario, Millennials are wary of traditional advisors as they have to beat the market by a large margin to even cover the high cost of commision and create any value.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Added to this, millennials also tend to have a heightened mistrust of financial institutions. This is due to the fact that most millennials grew up and had their most formative years during the great depression. The combination of these factors makes millennials hesitant to adhere to ‘status quo’ investment patterns, instead, they prefer to put their trust in tech-driven or DIY solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The paradigm shift: from trusting people to trusting Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest challenge in DIY investing is often getting started, what information to consume, what to disregard, and what to act on. The entire process gets a bit overwhelming as there’s information overload on the internet which tends to cripple modern-day investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Established news sites like Moneycontrol, Bloomberg, Economic Times, Financial times are all fine sources for investment advice, however, for a beginner investor, it can be a nightmare to track and monitor the news constantly and connect the right dots. Gathering the right inferences from a glut of data is what makes DIY investing so challenging.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Artificial intelligence based solutions offered by Robo advisors can help solve this problem, by creating curated and actionable advice according to goals set by investors. AI can churn through Terabytes of data, study market trends, make analyses and projections and give out predictions that minimize risks involved in DIY investing. The technology may seem complicated, but the end user benefits as they only have to act on ‘actionable advice’ while all the complicated algorithms do the number crunching for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robo-advisors chart the best course of action by analyzing goals, risk tolerance, and investment preferences. Investors can monitor the entire process through simplified dashboards that offer different levels of granularity. Most Robo-advisors are clear and transparent and often intuitive to modern day users who use apps for everything from ordering food, getting around town, and even dating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why Robo-advisors? &#8211; Convenient, low fees and DIY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The interest in Robo-advisors as an ideal solution for millennial investors is being spurred by increased transparency, accessibility, low fees and best in class customer experience offered by them as opposed to traditional advisors. The ability to invest via apps on their phone or on the web has led to another spurt in the growth the category.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most Robo-advisors charge up to 0.50% of total assets under management with most advisors offering free services until $5000 or $10,000, depending on their target audience. They also hold off on charging account-opening fees, withdrawal or account-closing fees, trading/commission fees, or account transfer fees and stick to clear and simple management fees to appeal to millennials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Is a Robo advisor the right fit for you?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are just getting started in investing and want to dabble in the markets yourself while still minimizing risks, Robo-advisors are your best bet. Their simplified user experience can help you monitor your finances on the go, eventually developing a taste for investments. Robo-advisors can help you temper your instincts and make better decisions, all without incurring the costs and inconveniences that come with a traditional human advisor. Even experienced investors are choosing to go the Robo route and transition from expensive actively managed accounts to low-cost automated alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robo advisory, however, is not a one size fits all solution. There needs to be careful consideration of one’s financial goals before settling on one. If you have a large and complicated estate, or you’re invested into many different types of assets a human touch may be necessary. They may also not be the right fit if you have specific needs that don’t fit traditional models such as succession planning, multi-currency portfolios etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, these aren’t really the target audience for Roboadvisors. If you have a fairly simple and more straightforward portfolio and you just want to get started, then Robo-advisors are the perfect starting point for your investing journey.</p>
